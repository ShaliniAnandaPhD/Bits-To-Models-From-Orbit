        "1. **What is the main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?**\n",
        "   *Answer: In supervised learning, models are trained using labeled data, meaning each input has a corresponding known output. In unsupervised learning, the data is not labeled, and the model identifies patterns and structures on its own.*\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Explain the role of a loss function in the training of a supervised learning model.**\n",
        "   *Answer: The loss function quantifies how well the model's predictions match the actual data. It is a measure of error, and the goal of training is to minimize this error by adjusting the model's parameters through an optimization algorithm.*\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What is overfitting in supervised learning, and how can it be prevented?**\n",
        "   *Answer: Overfitting occurs when a model is trained too well on the training data, capturing noise or random fluctuations, and hence performs poorly on unseen data. It can be prevented using techniques like regularization, cross-validation, or by using a simpler model.*\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Describe the purpose of dividing data into training and testing sets in supervised learning.**\n",
        "   *Answer: The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance. This division ensures that the model's ability to generalize to unseen data can be assessed, which helps in avoiding overfitting.*\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **In a classification problem, what is the difference between a binary classification and a multiclass classification?**\n",
        "   *Answer: In binary classification, there are only two classes or categories, so the model needs to distinguish between two possible outcomes. In multiclass classification, there are more than two classes, so the model needs to categorize inputs into one of several different classes.*\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **What are the typical steps involved in preprocessing data for a supervised learning task?**\n",
        "   *Answer: Preprocessing might include handling missing data, normalization or scaling of features, encoding categorical variables, feature extraction or selection, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.*\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Explain what gradient descent is and how it's used in supervised learning.**\n",
        "   *Answer: Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent or the negative gradient. It adjusts the model's parameters in small steps, reducing the error over time.*\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Why is it important to shuffle the data before splitting into training and testing sets in supervised learning?**\n",
        "   *Answer: Shuffling ensures that the training and testing sets are randomly sampled from the entire dataset. This prevents potential biases if the data is ordered or grouped in a particular way, ensuring a more accurate evaluation of the model's performance.*\n",
